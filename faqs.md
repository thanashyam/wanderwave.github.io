# What documents do I need to provide when I start booking?
Ensure you have copies of your passport ready. Please enter names exactly as they appear on your passport. If your passport does not include a last name, please contact us for further guidance.

# Can I lock in my travel rates after finalizing the itinerary?
Absolutely, you can secure your rates by making a payment of 50% of the total trip cost. This payment serves as a booking confirmation fee and ensures that your itinerary costs do not change.

# What if one of my scheduled experiences gets canceled?
This is a rare event, as we only work with top 5 partners in every destination. If sudden changes in weather or other such unforeseen events lead to cancellation, you will be refunded the amount for the experience as per the cancellation policy of the experience provider. Also, if there is sufficient heads up, we try and give you an equally exciting option, based on your interests.

**Our normal refund policy is 15 working days from the date of the cancelled activity or any other inclusion. In case there's a delay beyond this time, the team will keep the customer informed.**

# What occurs after I complete the payment?
Once your payment is processed, you will immediately receive a confirmation. Our system will then start the booking procedures, and we'll keep you updated along the way. Expect to receive an email detailing the status of all your bookings within 24 hours.

# What is the cancellation policy after payment is made?
Our cancellation policy varies by service. For flights, hotels, trains, and car rentals, cancellations follow the specific policies set by each provider. For activities and transfers, payments are non-refundable if cancelled within 21 days of departure. Additionally, our service fees are non-refundable once payment has been made.

# What should I do if I need to change activities after confirmation?
If you wish to modify an activity after confirmation, the change is subject to the cancellation policy detailed on your booking voucher. If the desired change is feasible and the new activity is available, you may proceed with making the change.

# Will prices change after I've completed my booking?
It's quite rare for prices to change after a booking is confirmed. However, fluctuations can occur, especially if multiple travelers are interested in the same accommodations or flights and these aren't blocked or reserved in advance. Should any changes arise post-booking due to these circumstances, we will notify you promptly and offer suitable alternatives to ensure your travel plans remain seamless.

# Why should I update cost frequently after I have built my itinerary and costed it?
We partner with the world’s top tech companies to get you real time pricing. Unlike other places where they have "hotel a or similar" - at Pickyourtrail - what you see is what you get. As millions of travellers like you are looking to head out, and hence, the hotel and flight availability changes by the minute. To ensure that you get the best possible room, we need to continuously update the costing.

# What is your price match guarantee and how does it apply?
We work with suppliers from all across the world to get you the best possible pricing at most of the time. If you find a a lower price on the internet from any other online travel agent for the same inclusions on the same travel dates, we will match the quote you find and also waive our planning and concierge fee for you! Offer applicable against published rates of other online travel agents and not on off-line quotations / promo code applied rates.
